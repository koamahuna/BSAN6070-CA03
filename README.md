Decision tree modeling
#Name of project Decision Trees CA03

#Project Overview In this project, I have performed exploratory data anlysis on a dataset on census data. Following this, I have fitted a decision tree in order to predict the income of a person given certain characteristics. I have tested a few different sets of specififcations in order to achieve this.

#Config Instructions This program was written in Google Colab and should run there easily. It was written on a Windows operating system.

#Installation Instructions The first block of code includes the packages necessary for this to run but i will list them here as well: os, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, [confusion matrix, accuracy score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc curve, auc curve] from sklearn.metrics, stringIO, Image, export_graphviz, pydotplus, sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassfier, from sklearn import preprocessing

#Operating instructions You will need to upload the data file into your session.

#A list of files included I have included a python notebook complete with the code and analysis written by me. Additionally I have added the data file. It is in a zip folder to save space so you will unzip it and upload it into your preferred environment to run it.
